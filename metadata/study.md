## Study info

TwinLife is a 12-year representative behavior genetic study investigating the emergence and development of social inequalities over the life course.

The long-term project began in 2014 and surveys more than 4,000 pairs of twins and their families in different stages of life on a yearly basis. All of the subjects reside in Germany. 
Not only social, but also genetic mechanisms as well as covariations and interactions between these two factors can be examined with the help of identical and fraternal same-sex twins.

In order to document the individual development of different aspects it is important to examine the families extensively over the course of several years. Six important contextual domains 
are focused on: 1.) Education and academic performance / skill development, 2.) career and labor market attainment, 3.) integration and participation in social, cultural and political life, 
4.) quality of life and perceived capabilities, 5.) physical and psychological health and 6.) behavioral problems and deviant behavior.

In order to take a close look at the development of social inequalities, TwinLife does not only examine different etiological factors, but also different indicators of personal and social 
success and failure respectively. On part of the conditional factors genetic disposition as well as aspects of the environment that the children and adolescents are living in are considered. 
On part of the consequences not only objective but also subjective information is observed. Children are born into an environment which influences them, but on the other hand they react and 
interact differently depending on their individual characteristics and thereby shape their environment. To allow for an accurate examination of the reciprocal processes by which individual 
dispositions and environmental conditions influence each other, data on the illustrated characteristics will be collected over a period of twelve years.

## Method

The TwinLife panel combines a sequential cohort-design with an extended twin family-design (ETFD). The related surveys are conducted yearly, whereat the mode alternates between face-to-face at 
home, including some tests, and telephone interviews. Parts of the face-to-face surveys are conducted in parallel modes, i.e., as computer assisted or paper-and-pencil self-interviews.

The sequential cohort-design comprises four cohorts: The youngest twins in cohort 1 (birth years 2009 and 2010) are about 5 years of age at the time of the first survey in 2014 and 2015. The 
oldest twins in cohort 4 (birth years 1990 to 1993) are about 31 to 32 years of age at the time of the last survey in 2022 and 2023. The twins in cohorts 2 and 3 are born in the years 2003 to 
2004 and 1997 to 1998, respectively. This design enables the TwinLife panel to cover an age range between 5 and 32 years with a data collection phase of 10 years. This age range covers important 
life-course transitions from school entry to the labor market entry phase as well as critical life stages for mating and family formation.

As part of the ETFD, in addition to the twins themselves the biological and if applicable social parents as well as the sibling that is closest in age to the twins are surveyed. Moreover, the 
partners of adult twins are included as well. This family perspective enables comparisons regarding different degrees of genetic similarity, and it is important to analyze the manifold influences 
of the family environment on the development of the twins in greater detail.

**Geographic Coverage:** Germany
 
**Universe:** Twins and their families (Extended Twin Family Design, ETFD): Monozygotic and dizygotic same-sex twin pairs born in the following years: 1.) 1990 and 1991, 2.) 1997, 3.) 2003 and 
4.) 2009 (4 birth cohorts)

plus at least one biological parent

(+ if possible the other biological parent, step-parent(-s), one sibling and the twins' partners)
 
**Selection Method:** Twin families are drawn from local resident registers in communities with at least 5,000 inhabitants in Germany. The twin families are recognized as such if two same-sex 
people with the same date of birth lived in the same household. Then, it was checked whether the selected persons were twins indeed.
 
**Mode of Data Collection:** 
*Face-to-Face data collection:* Household interviews with the family via three different interview modes (CAPI, CASI, Paper-and-Pencil) plus cognitive tests, scans/photos of certificates and children's health record books.
*CATI data collection:* Telephone interview with one family member (from second CATI wave onwards; before: telephone interview with each family member above the age of 10 that participated in the preceding Face-to-Face wave)
 
**Survey institute:** TNS Infratest / Kantar TNS (first Face-to-Face household survey, parts of the first telephone survey); infas Institut fÃ¼r angewandte Sozialwissenschaft 
(parts of the first telephone survey, second Face-to-Face household survey)

### Data files

- **Master data (ZA6701_master_v$)**: Includes information on the gross sample, such as consistency checked variables that are stable over time (sex, year of birth, relation to the twins, zygosity, migration background) and wave-specific variables (person type, response status) about all individuals included in TwinLife in each wave.

- **Survey data in person format with filter error adjustment (ZA6701_person_wid$_v$)**: There is one data set for each regular data collection (F2F 1, CATI 1, F2F 2, CATI 2) and the supplementary COVID-19 survey (CoV1). The data collection identifier is the variable wid. The additional survey identifier for the supplementary COVID-19 survey is cov. Each surveyed person has one data row (pid). The data were filter-cleaned, i.e. data were deleted if the question was not intended for a person according to the filter instructions. These datasets are documented on paneldata.org.

It is up to the users to decide how to handle the information provided by the respondents.

- **Survey data in family format (ZA6701_family_wide_wid$_v$.dta)**: There is one data set for each data collection (F2F 1, CATI 1, F2F 2, CATI 2). Each family has one data row with information of each participating person in the family being stored in separate variables/columns). Person format and family format data sets contain the same data using different structures.
