Respondents in CATI 2 include parents of twins in cohorts 1 and 2 and twins in cohorts 3 and 4. Unlike the other data collections in TwinLife, the information on the family members who were not personally interviewed was obtained as proxy information. Self-report and proxy-report are directly linked to the corresponding person types in the Scientific-Use-File. The variable **proxy** indicates whether the report is a self-report or a proxy-report. A total of 2299 families participated in the survey. 

The target persons in CATI 2 include:

- Cohorts 1 and 2: one parent or stepparent per pair of twins  
- Cohorts 3 and 4: both twins (if it was not possible to contact at least one twin per family, then one parent per twin pair was interviewed)

Four questionnaire versions (QV) were used in the CATI2 survey (see variable **version_fq**): 

- QV1: In cohorts 1 and 2, one parent was interviewed per family. The interviewed parent answered the family and interviewer questionnaire and provided self and proxy information about the twins and the other parent/partner in the personal questionnaire.
- QV2: In cohorts 3 and 4, both twins were interviewed per family. The twin interviewed first answered the family and interviewer questionnaire and provided self-information and proxy information about the parents and her/his own partner in the personal questionnaire. If the interviewed twin provided proxy information about the other twin in FV2, this information is overwritten with the other twin's responses from FV3 if the FV3 interview was conducted.
- QV3: In cohorts 3 and 4, both twins were interviewed per family. The last twin interviewed answered the interview questionnaire and provided self-information and proxy information about his/her own partner in the personal questionnaire. 
- QV4: In cohorts 3 and 4, one parent per family was interviewed when the twins were unavailable. The respondent answered the family and interviewer questionnaire and provided self and proxy information about the twins, the other parent/partner, and the twins' partner in the personal questionnaire. This version of the questionnaire was used in 2 cases only.",""
