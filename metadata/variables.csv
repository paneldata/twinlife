For reasons of data protection, the age in years to the day on the date of the family questionnaire (without change of the day of birth, as in **age0110**) cannot be released in the scientific use file. However, **age0110** is used to filter the questions. In most cases, **age0100** and **age0110** are identical. All age variables are based on the respondent's date of birth. This specification can be corrected by the respondent in each wave and is plausibilized longitudinally for further data processing. In the case of inconsistencies in an individual's date of birth, the most frequently given date of birth is used.

In the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2), it was explicitly asked for the first citizenship as well as for the second citizenship, if applicable (including the offering of an open answer). The corresponding variables are **mig0550(t/u/s)** - **mig0553(t/u/s)**). The citizenship was surveyed of all respondents in both F2F 1 and F2F 2. It is stored, like the other migration variables, as constant variable in the master.

If the twins' and the sibling's statements about their father's country of birth differ, the statement that is shared by two out of three is designated as the father's country of birth. If there is no unambiguous information about the father's country of birth, the value -81 (contradictory information) is assigned.  
**mig3200** is stored in the master data set.

The migration background was constructed for twins with at least one (grand-)parental information available. In cases where the information on the country of birth is contradicting but it is known that the respondent is born abroad, the information about the foreign birth is used without considering the particular country.

In the first face-to-face data collection (F2F 1) the citizenship was surveyed in a multicoding format as a self-report and a proxy-report of parents about their children, offering the respondent to mention one or several citizenships and give open answers (**mig0500(t/u/s)** - **mig0519(t/u/s)**). In the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2), it was explicitly asked for the first citizenship as well as for the second citizenship, if applicable (including the offering of an open answer). The corresponding variables are **mig0550(t/u/s)** - **mig0553(t/u/s)**). The citizenship was surveyed of all respondents in both F2F 1 and F2F 2. It is stored, like the other migration variables, as constant variable in the master.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_cov2_v7-0-0","mig2200","mig2200","The country of birth was surveyed in the first face-to-face data collection (F2F 1) as a self-report (respondents aged 16 or above, **mig0100**, **mig0101**), proxy-report of parents about their children aged below 16 (twins and sibling, **mig0100t/u/s**, **mig0101t/u/s**) as well as a proxy-report about the own parents (**mig0300**, **mig0301**, **mig0400**, **mig0401**; persons aged 16 or above). 
In F2F 2 only first-time respondents were asked for their country of birth. In F2F 3, the country of birth was not surveyed. The information was collected by providing a list as well as the opportunity to give an open answer. For data privacy reasons the answers were recoded into country groups and stored in generated variables, where the proxy-reports of the twins and the sibling about their parents were integrated into **mig2100** and **mig2200**. 
Please note that self-reports of the parents about the country of their birth are *not* used for the generation of **mig2100** and **mig2200** (e.g. **mig0100** of the twins' father for the generation of **mig2200**, etc.). For an extension of the generation, see **mig3100** and **mig220g**. It can be derived from the table *mig2000_countrygroups.pdf* ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/mig2000_countrygroups.pdf)) in the downloads section ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads)) of the TwinLife documentation website which countries were included in which group.
Please also note that different statements of twins and the sibling about the country of birth of their parents are not harmonized. In about 30 cases the given information differs between the siblings. The treatment of contradicting information is addressed in **mig3100** and **mig3200**. 
**mig2200** is stored in the master data set.

In F2F 2 only first-time respondents were asked for their country of birth. In F2F 3, the country of birth was not surveyed. The information was collected by providing a list as well as the opportunity to give an open answer. For data privacy reasons the answers were recoded into country groups and stored in generated variables, where the proxy-reports of the twins and the sibling about their parents were integrated into **mig2100** and **mig2200**. 
Please note that self-reports of the parents about the country of their birth are *not* used for the generation of **mig2100** and **mig2200** (e.g. **mig0100** of the twins' father for the generation of **mig2200**, etc.). For an extension of the generation, see **mig3100** and **mig220g**. It can be derived from the table *mig2000_countrygroups.pdf* ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/mig2000_countrygroups.pdf)) in the downloads section ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads)) of the TwinLife documentation website which countries were included in which group.
Please also note that different statements of twins and the sibling about the country of birth of their parents are not harmonized. In about 30 cases the given information differs between the siblings. The treatment of contradicting information is addressed in **mig3100** and **mig3200**.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid1_v7-0-0","eca0108","eca0108","The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is a classification of educational attainment and level of education. The ISCED classification takes into account the country-specific complexity of educational programs in terms of the type and duration of school or training. It ranges from 0 (pre-primary level of education) to 6 (second stage of tertiary education, leading to an advanced research qualification). The qualifications of the German education system can be assigned to the following ISCED-97 levels (cf. Schneider 2008):- Level 0: Pre-primary education, such as Kindergarten- Level 1: Primary school- Level 2B: Elementary and lower secondary school and apprenticeship training- Level 2A: Realschule, Mittlere Reife and Polytechnische Oberschule (GDR)- Level 3B: Vocational training in the dual system, intermediate administrative training, vocational/college school-leaving certificate and one-year schools of health services- Level 3A: Advanced technical college entrance qualification and Abitur (A-levels)- Level 4B: Combination of two vocational degrees in ISCED 3B- Level 4A: Qualification in both levels 3A and 3B- Level 5B: Master craftsman/technician, 2 to 3 year school of health services, technical/vocational academy, technical school diploma (GDR) and technical school of administration- Level 5A: Fachhochschule degree, university degree- Level 6: Doctorate, PhDThe variable **eca0108** is constructed from the two generated variables for the highest school leaving certificate (**eca0130**) and the highest vocational qualification (**eca0230**). The ISCED variable generated for TwinLife does not include level 2B, as information on pre-vocational programs is not available. In F2F2 (in contrast to F2F 1), additionally to the highest vocational qualification, information on a further professional qualification (**eca0221**) was collected. This also allows ISCED level 4B (combination of two vocational qualifications in level 3B) to be coded in F2F 2. However, a retroactive adjustment for F2F 1 could not be made, as the year of completion of the further education was not available. There is also no information on the length of training at health schools. In these cases, a minimum of two years was assumed when classifying according to ISCED levels.Please note that **eca0108** cannot be used as an ordinal scale because ISCED levels are divided into subcategories (e.g. levels 5A and 5B, where level 5A is a more advanced qualification than level 5B).For more information on the ISCED classification, see OECD (1999), and Schneider (2008).

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid1_v7-0-0","eca0205","eca0205","The International Standard Classification of Occupations from 2008 (ISCO-08) classifies occupations (internationally comparably) considering the required skill level (degree of complexity, based on the educational qualification) of an occupation as well as the skill specialization (the type of skills that are needed especially for this occupation). TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**). 
For more information about the ISCO classification visit the ILO website ([URL Link](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm)). The open-ended responses on occupation were coded into ISCO-08 by the survey institute (TNS Infratest/Kantar for F2F 1, infas for F2F 2). Infratest performs the coding on the basis of an electronically available directory developed by Statistik Austria (see TNS Infratest/Kantar ISCO-08 documentation ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/ISCO-08_coding_Infratest.pdf)) on the TwinLife documentation website ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads))). Infas bases the ISCO coding on specifications developed by GESIS. The exact procedure of occupation coding was described in detail by Geis and Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik (2000) using ISCO-88 as an example. In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS.

**eca0207** represents the ISEI of the occupation/career/field of study of the highest professional qualification. The variable has been coded on the basis of the four-digit version of the ISCO-08 classification of the highest professional qualification (please note that only the two-digit version of ISCO-08 is part of the SUF, see **eca0205**).

In subsequent data collections, newly acquired professional degrees were collected and the previously recorded professional qualification was replaced if the newly acquired qualification was a higher professional degree. The second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2) again asked for the highest professional qualification as well as any further professional degree. If a higher professional certificate was reported in the second face-to-face data collection and the certificate was obtained before the interview of the first data collection, the highest professional qualification was corrected retroactively. The same applies to the family members who indicated in the first wave that they had obtained a degree from a 'Berufsakademie or Fachhochschule' (university of applied sciences, university of cooperative education). While these degrees were recorded jointly into one category in the first data collection (category 8), separate categories were introduced in the subsequent data collection (categories 6 and 7). A retroactive correction is thus made for those family members for whom both F2F1 and F2F2 contain information on the highest degree. The respondents' information on a second professional qualification (only available from F2F2) was also taken into account if this could be recognized as a higher qualification. Open statements were recoded into categories 1 to 10. Open entries that could not be assigned to these categories were recoded into -89 (not codable).",""

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid1_v7-0-0","emp0503","emp0503","The International Standard Classification of Occupations from 2008 (ISCO-08) classifies occupations (internationally comparably) considering the required skill level (degree of complexity, based on the educational qualification) of an occupation as well as the skill specialization (the type of skills that are needed especially for this occupation). TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**). For more information about the ISCO classification visit the ILO website ([URL Link](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm)). The open-ended responses on occupation were coded into ISCO-08 by the survey institute (TNS Infratest/Kantar for F2F 1, infas for F2F 2), taking the following information into account, if available: occupational status (**emp0600**), public service yes/no (**emp0702**), supervisiory function (**emp0601**, **emp0603**, **emp0605**), type of managerial position (**emp0606**), educational degree (**eca0100**), and vocational training (**eca0200**). Infratest performs the coding on the basis of an electronically available directory developed by Statistik Austria (see TNS Infratest/Kantar ISCO-08 documentation ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/ISCO-08_coding_Infratest.pdf)) on the TwinLife documentation website ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads))). Infas bases the ISCO coding on specifications developed by GESIS. The exact procedure of occupation coding was described in detail by Geis and Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik (2000) using ISCO-88 as an example. In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

*Please note*: In the telephone surveys (CATI 1, CATI 2, etc.), questions about current occupation were only asked if the occupation had changed since the last survey (CATI 1: IF emp1400==1; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==2). For respondents who did not indicate a change in occupation (CATI 1: IF emp1400==2; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==1), we fill in **emp0503** on current occupation with information from the previous data collection. Note that some detailed employment information (such as detailed occupational status) was not asked in CATI to code occupation in ISCO-08 comparable to F2F 1 and F2F 2 when there was an occupational change. A direct comparison with the information in the face-to-face surveys may not be possible in some cases as a result.

The information required to create ESeC is: occupation coded to the minor groups (i.e. 3-digit groups) of the EU variant of the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO88 (COM)); details of employment status, i.e. whether an employer, self-employed or employee; number of employees at the workplace; whether a worker is a supervisor.

Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein belong to former Western Germany; Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia belong to former Eastern Germany. According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Berlin as a whole is count as part of former Eastern Germany. **ewi** is available on the household level.

For F2F2 CFT-20 data, checking routines revealed two cases that seemed invalid and were set missing. Also, scores for particular subset were set invalid for 74 subtest scores due to e.g., complete missingness, interviewer comments or response patterns. Please note that - in rare cases - participants were falsely treated as new to the sample in F2F 2 and therefore took the test a second time. In these cases there are two test results (in F2F 1 and F2F 2).

In order to ensure the anonymity of the twin families, very high and very low values of the personal income variable **inc0100** is manipulated in a way that the incomes cannot lead back to one individual, but the income distribution, as well as analyses, are not affected by the alterations. The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). Personal income was collected in variable **inc0100** in all data collections except CATI 2 and 3. First, only for CATI 1 a categorical variable (corresponding to **inc0103**) is generated from the variables **inc0102**, **inc0105**, **inc0106**. In the next step, for the cases in which no monthly personal income was reported, the annual income from **inc0101** (if available) is divided by 12 and integrated into **inc0100**. A single case correction was made in F2F 1, where monthly and annual income were obviously confused (**pid_suf** == 124589400). Other conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0120** and **inc0121**. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable. As a result, 80% of the incomes are not affected by the manipulation. The resulting manipulated variable **inc0110** is supplied in the SUF.

The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). In order to process a maximum of income information, the first step is to integrate the specification of income categories from **inc0403** into the variable **inc0400**. Here, the middle of the specified category is used. In F2F 2, CATI 2 and F2F 3, the yearly household income (**inc0404**) was also recorded as an alternative - this information is also converted first (divided by 12) and then integrated into **inc0400**. In CATI 1, household income was recorded at the personal level. Therefore, it may happen that within one household several different household incomes are specified. Here, the median of all information provided in the household was used. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent. As a result, mean and median incomes are much lower than in previous data collections in these cohorts.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid1_v7-0-0","inc0411","inc0411","Besides the (manipulated) household income, we generate and provide the net equivalent household income using the modified OECD scale ([http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf](http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf)). For this generated variable, the household size and composition are taken into account. The concept is based on the assumption that people (e.g., two adults) save money and are fictitiously 'richer' by living together in one household and sharing a common budget and the fixed costs instead of living in separate households. For more information about the concept, see OECD (2011). For this purpose, the household composition recorded in the household questionnaire is used to calculate how many adult persons (aged 14 and older) and how many children (under 14) live in the household. In CATI 2 and 3, the household composition was not recorded systematically by the interviewer, but was surveyed in the household questionnaire. This self-report of the respondent was used as the basis for calculating the equivalence income. According to OECD (2011), the 'household head' gets a weight of 1, each further adult person gets a weight of 0.5, and each child a weight of 0.3. The household income is then divided by the sum of all weights in the household. The resulting variable **inc0411**, the net equivalent household income, is published in the SUF.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent.

In the first face-to-face data collection (F2F 1) the citizenship was surveyed in a multicoding format as a self-report and a proxy-report of parents about their children, offering the respondent to mention one or several citizenships and give open answers (**mig0500(t/u/s)** - **mig0519(t/u/s)**). In the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2), it was explicitly asked for the first citizenship as well as for the second citizenship, if applicable (including the offering of an open answer). The corresponding variables are **mig0550(t/u/s)** - **mig0553(t/u/s)**). The citizenship was surveyed of all respondents in both F2F 1 and F2F 2. It is stored, like the other migration variables, as constant variable in the master.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid1_v7-0-0","mig2200","mig2200","The country of birth was surveyed in the first face-to-face data collection (F2F 1) as a self-report (respondents aged 16 or above, **mig0100**, **mig0101**), proxy-report of parents about their children aged below 16 (twins and sibling, **mig0100t/u/s**, **mig0101t/u/s**) as well as a proxy-report about the own parents (**mig0300**, **mig0301**, **mig0400**, **mig0401**; persons aged 16 or above). 
In F2F 2 only first-time respondents were asked for their country of birth. In F2F 3, the country of birth was not surveyed. The information was collected by providing a list as well as the opportunity to give an open answer. For data privacy reasons the answers were recoded into country groups and stored in generated variables, where the proxy-reports of the twins and the sibling about their parents were integrated into **mig2100** and **mig2200**. 
Please note that self-reports of the parents about the country of their birth are *not* used for the generation of **mig2100** and **mig2200** (e.g. **mig0100** of the twins' father for the generation of **mig2200**, etc.). For an extension of the generation, see **mig3100** and **mig220g**. It can be derived from the table *mig2000_countrygroups.pdf* ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/mig2000_countrygroups.pdf)) in the downloads section ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads)) of the TwinLife documentation website which countries were included in which group.
Please also note that different statements of twins and the sibling about the country of birth of their parents are not harmonized. In about 30 cases the given information differs between the siblings. The treatment of contradicting information is addressed in **mig3100** and **mig3200**. 
**mig2200** is stored in the master data set.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid2_v7-0-0","bpa0208","bpa0208","The International Standard Classification of Occupations from 2008 (ISCO-08) classifies occupations (internationally comparably) considering the required skill level (degree of complexity, based on the educational qualification) of an occupation as well as the skill specialization (the type of skills that are needed especially for this occupation). TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**).

In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. 
Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid2_v7-0-0","eca0108","eca0108","The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is a classification of educational attainment and level of education. The ISCED classification takes into account the country-specific complexity of educational programs in terms of the type and duration of school or training. It ranges from 0 (pre-primary level of education) to 6 (second stage of tertiary education, leading to an advanced research qualification). The qualifications of the German education system can be assigned to the following ISCED-97 levels (cf. Schneider 2008):- Level 0: Pre-primary education, such as Kindergarten- Level 1: Primary school- Level 2B: Elementary and lower secondary school and apprenticeship training- Level 2A: Realschule, Mittlere Reife and Polytechnische Oberschule (GDR)- Level 3B: Vocational training in the dual system, intermediate administrative training, vocational/college school-leaving certificate and one-year schools of health services- Level 3A: Advanced technical college entrance qualification and Abitur (A-levels)- Level 4B: Combination of two vocational degrees in ISCED 3B- Level 4A: Qualification in both levels 3A and 3B- Level 5B: Master craftsman/technician, 2 to 3 year school of health services, technical/vocational academy, technical school diploma (GDR) and technical school of administration- Level 5A: Fachhochschule degree, university degree- Level 6: Doctorate, PhDThe variable **eca0108** is constructed from the two generated variables for the highest school leaving certificate (**eca0130**) and the highest vocational qualification (**eca0230**). The ISCED variable generated for TwinLife does not include level 2B, as information on pre-vocational programs is not available. In F2F2 (in contrast to F2F 1), additionally to the highest vocational qualification, information on a further professional qualification (**eca0221**) was collected. This also allows ISCED level 4B (combination of two vocational qualifications in level 3B) to be coded in F2F 2. However, a retroactive adjustment for F2F 1 could not be made, as the year of completion of the further education was not available. There is also no information on the length of training at health schools. In these cases, a minimum of two years was assumed when classifying according to ISCED levels.Please note that **eca0108** cannot be used as an ordinal scale because ISCED levels are divided into subcategories (e.g. levels 5A and 5B, where level 5A is a more advanced qualification than level 5B).For more information on the ISCED classification, see OECD (1999), and Schneider (2008).

Please note: For those participants who stated in the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2) that they had obtained a new school leaving certificate, the information on the highest school leaving certificate was collected again. For some respondents who were wrongly identified as first-surveyed respondents, there are also duplicate entries in F2F1 and F2F2. If a higher school leaving certificate was reported in F2F 2 and the certificate was obtained before the interview of the first data collection, the highest school qualification was corrected retroactively. Open statements were recoded into categories 1 to 5. Special school qualifications (Foerderschule) were equated with the 'Hauptschulabschluss'.

In subsequent data collections, newly acquired professional degrees were collected and the previously recorded professional qualification was replaced if the newly acquired qualification was a higher professional degree. The second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2) again asked for the highest professional qualification as well as any further professional degree. If a higher professional certificate was reported in the second face-to-face data collection and the certificate was obtained before the interview of the first data collection, the highest professional qualification was corrected retroactively. The same applies to the family members who indicated in the first wave that they had obtained a degree from a 'Berufsakademie or Fachhochschule' (university of applied sciences, university of cooperative education). While these degrees were recorded jointly into one category in the first data collection (category 8), separate categories were introduced in the subsequent data collection (categories 6 and 7). A retroactive correction is thus made for those family members for whom both F2F1 and F2F2 contain information on the highest degree. The respondents' information on a second professional qualification (only available from F2F2) was also taken into account if this could be recognized as a higher qualification.

TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**). For more information about the ISCO classification visit the ILO website ([URL Link](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm)). The open-ended responses on occupation were coded into ISCO-08 by the survey institute (TNS Infratest/Kantar for F2F 1, infas for F2F 2), taking the following information into account, if available: occupational status (**emp0600**), public service yes/no (**emp0702**), supervisiory function (**emp0601**, **emp0603**, **emp0605**), type of managerial position (**emp0606**), educational degree (**eca0100**), and vocational training (**eca0200**). Infratest performs the coding on the basis of an electronically available directory developed by Statistik Austria (see TNS Infratest/Kantar ISCO-08 documentation ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/ISCO-08_coding_Infratest.pdf)) on the TwinLife documentation website ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads))). Infas bases the ISCO coding on specifications developed by GESIS. The exact procedure of occupation coding was described in detail by Geis and Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik (2000) using ISCO-88 as an example. In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

*Please note*: In the telephone surveys (CATI 1, CATI 2, etc.), questions about current occupation were only asked if the occupation had changed since the last survey (CATI 1: IF emp1400==1; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==2). For respondents who did not indicate a change in occupation (CATI 1: IF emp1400==2; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==1), we fill in **emp0503** on current occupation with information from the previous data collection. Note that some detailed employment information (such as detailed occupational status) was not asked in CATI to code occupation in ISCO-08 comparable to F2F 1 and F2F 2 when there was an occupational change. A direct comparison with the information in the face-to-face surveys may not be possible in some cases as a result.

Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

*Please note*: In the telephone surveys (CATI 1, CATI 2, etc.), questions about current occupation were only asked if the occupation had changed since the last survey (CATI 1: IF emp1400==1; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==2). For respondents who did not indicate a change in occupation (CATI 1: IF emp1400==2; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==1), we fill in **emp0503** on current occupation with information from the previous data collection. Note that some detailed employment information (such as detailed occupational status) was not asked in CATI to code occupation in ISCO-08 comparable to F2F 1 and F2F 2 when there was an occupational change. A direct comparison with the information in the face-to-face surveys may not be possible in some cases as a result.

First, only for CATI 1 a categorical variable (corresponding to **inc0103**) is generated from the variables **inc0102**, **inc0105**, **inc0106**. In the next step, for the cases in which no monthly personal income was reported, the annual income from **inc0101** (if available) is divided by 12 and integrated into **inc0100**. A single case correction was made in F2F 1, where monthly and annual income were obviously confused (**pid_suf** == 124589400). Other conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0120** and **inc0121**. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable.

In order to ensure the anonymity of the twin families, very high and very low values of the household income variable **inc0400** are manipulated in a way that the incomes cannot lead back to one household or individual, but the income distribution, as well as analyses, are not affected by the alterations. The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). In order to process a maximum of income information, the first step is to integrate the specification of income categories from **inc0403** into the variable **inc0400**. Here, the middle of the specified category is used. In F2F 2, CATI 2 and F2F 3, the yearly household income (**inc0404**) was also recorded as an alternative - this information is also converted first (divided by 12) and then integrated into **inc0400**. In CATI 1, household income was recorded at the personal level. Therefore, it may happen that within one household several different household incomes are specified. Here, the median of all information provided in the household was used. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable. As a result, 80% of the incomes are not affected by the manipulation. The resulting manipulated variable **inc0401** is supplied in the SUF. Conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0420**, **inc0421**,  **inc0423** and  **inc0423**.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent. As a result, mean and median incomes are much lower than in previous data collections in these cohorts.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid2_v7-0-0","inc0411","inc0411","Besides the (manipulated) household income, we generate and provide the net equivalent household income using the modified OECD scale ([http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf](http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf)). For this generated variable, the household size and composition are taken into account. The concept is based on the assumption that people (e.g., two adults) save money and are fictitiously 'richer' by living together in one household and sharing a common budget and the fixed costs instead of living in separate households. For more information about the concept, see OECD (2011). For this purpose, the household composition recorded in the household questionnaire is used to calculate how many adult persons (aged 14 and older) and how many children (under 14) live in the household. In CATI 2 and 3, the household composition was not recorded systematically by the interviewer, but was surveyed in the household questionnaire. This self-report of the respondent was used as the basis for calculating the equivalence income. According to OECD (2011), the 'household head' gets a weight of 1, each further adult person gets a weight of 0.5, and each child a weight of 0.3. The household income is then divided by the sum of all weights in the household. The resulting variable **inc0411**, the net equivalent household income, is published in the SUF.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid3_v7-0-0","eca0108","eca0108","The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is a classification of educational attainment and level of education. The ISCED classification takes into account the country-specific complexity of educational programs in terms of the type and duration of school or training. It ranges from 0 (pre-primary level of education) to 6 (second stage of tertiary education, leading to an advanced research qualification). The qualifications of the German education system can be assigned to the following ISCED-97 levels (cf. Schneider 2008):- Level 0: Pre-primary education, such as Kindergarten- Level 1: Primary school- Level 2B: Elementary and lower secondary school and apprenticeship training- Level 2A: Realschule, Mittlere Reife and Polytechnische Oberschule (GDR)- Level 3B: Vocational training in the dual system, intermediate administrative training, vocational/college school-leaving certificate and one-year schools of health services- Level 3A: Advanced technical college entrance qualification and Abitur (A-levels)- Level 4B: Combination of two vocational degrees in ISCED 3B- Level 4A: Qualification in both levels 3A and 3B- Level 5B: Master craftsman/technician, 2 to 3 year school of health services, technical/vocational academy, technical school diploma (GDR) and technical school of administration- Level 5A: Fachhochschule degree, university degree- Level 6: Doctorate, PhDThe variable **eca0108** is constructed from the two generated variables for the highest school leaving certificate (**eca0130**) and the highest vocational qualification (**eca0230**). The ISCED variable generated for TwinLife does not include level 2B, as information on pre-vocational programs is not available. In F2F2 (in contrast to F2F 1), additionally to the highest vocational qualification, information on a further professional qualification (**eca0221**) was collected. This also allows ISCED level 4B (combination of two vocational qualifications in level 3B) to be coded in F2F 2. However, a retroactive adjustment for F2F 1 could not be made, as the year of completion of the further education was not available. There is also no information on the length of training at health schools. In these cases, a minimum of two years was assumed when classifying according to ISCED levels.Please note that **eca0108** cannot be used as an ordinal scale because ISCED levels are divided into subcategories (e.g. levels 5A and 5B, where level 5A is a more advanced qualification than level 5B).For more information on the ISCED classification, see OECD (1999), and Schneider (2008).

TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**). 
For more information about the ISCO classification visit the ILO website ([URL Link](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm)). The open-ended responses on occupation were coded into ISCO-08 by the survey institute (TNS Infratest/Kantar for F2F 1, infas for F2F 2). Infratest performs the coding on the basis of an electronically available directory developed by Statistik Austria (see TNS Infratest/Kantar ISCO-08 documentation ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/ISCO-08_coding_Infratest.pdf)) on the TwinLife documentation website ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads))). Infas bases the ISCO coding on specifications developed by GESIS. The exact procedure of occupation coding was described in detail by Geis and Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik (2000) using ISCO-88 as an example. In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. 
Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid3_v7-0-0","emp0503","emp0503","The International Standard Classification of Occupations from 2008 (ISCO-08) classifies occupations (internationally comparably) considering the required skill level (degree of complexity, based on the educational qualification) of an occupation as well as the skill specialization (the type of skills that are needed especially for this occupation). TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**). For more information about the ISCO classification visit the ILO website ([URL Link](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm)). The open-ended responses on occupation were coded into ISCO-08 by the survey institute (TNS Infratest/Kantar for F2F 1, infas for F2F 2), taking the following information into account, if available: occupational status (**emp0600**), public service yes/no (**emp0702**), supervisiory function (**emp0601**, **emp0603**, **emp0605**), type of managerial position (**emp0606**), educational degree (**eca0100**), and vocational training (**eca0200**). Infratest performs the coding on the basis of an electronically available directory developed by Statistik Austria (see TNS Infratest/Kantar ISCO-08 documentation ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/ISCO-08_coding_Infratest.pdf)) on the TwinLife documentation website ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads))). Infas bases the ISCO coding on specifications developed by GESIS. The exact procedure of occupation coding was described in detail by Geis and Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik (2000) using ISCO-88 as an example. In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

*Please note*: In the telephone surveys (CATI 1, CATI 2, etc.), questions about current occupation were only asked if the occupation had changed since the last survey (CATI 1: IF emp1400==1; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==2). For respondents who did not indicate a change in occupation (CATI 1: IF emp1400==2; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==1), we fill in **emp0503** on current occupation with information from the previous data collection. Note that some detailed employment information (such as detailed occupational status) was not asked in CATI to code occupation in ISCO-08 comparable to F2F 1 and F2F 2 when there was an occupational change. A direct comparison with the information in the face-to-face surveys may not be possible in some cases as a result.

It was developed from the EGP (Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero) scheme. The categories of the ESeC summarize occupations according to their position in the labor market and the type of labor regulation. The information required to create ESeC is: occupation coded to the minor groups (i.e. 3-digit groups) of the EU variant of the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO88 (COM)); details of employment status, i.e. whether an employer, self-employed or employee; number of employees at the workplace; whether a worker is a supervisor.

In order to ensure the anonymity of the twin families, very high and very low values of the personal income variable **inc0100** is manipulated in a way that the incomes cannot lead back to one individual, but the income distribution, as well as analyses, are not affected by the alterations. The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). Personal income was collected in variable **inc0100** in all data collections except CATI 2 and 3. First, only for CATI 1 a categorical variable (corresponding to **inc0103**) is generated from the variables **inc0102**, **inc0105**, **inc0106**. In the next step, for the cases in which no monthly personal income was reported, the annual income from **inc0101** (if available) is divided by 12 and integrated into **inc0100**. A single case correction was made in F2F 1, where monthly and annual income were obviously confused (**pid_suf** == 124589400). Other conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0120** and **inc0121**. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable. As a result, 80% of the incomes are not affected by the manipulation. The resulting manipulated variable **inc0110** is supplied in the SUF.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid3_v7-0-0","inc0401","inc0401","Twin families are a special type of family that could be de-anonymized more easily than other families when combining several characteristics known from the data, especially when these characteristics exceedingly diverge from the average, such as a very high or very low income. In order to ensure the anonymity of the twin families, very high and very low values of the household income variable **inc0400** are manipulated in a way that the incomes cannot lead back to one household or individual, but the income distribution, as well as analyses, are not affected by the alterations. The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). In order to process a maximum of income information, the first step is to integrate the specification of income categories from **inc0403** into the variable **inc0400**. Here, the middle of the specified category is used. In F2F 2, CATI 2 and F2F 3, the yearly household income (**inc0404**) was also recorded as an alternative - this information is also converted first (divided by 12) and then integrated into **inc0400**. In CATI 1, household income was recorded at the personal level. Therefore, it may happen that within one household several different household incomes are specified. Here, the median of all information provided in the household was used. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable. As a result, 80% of the incomes are not affected by the manipulation. The resulting manipulated variable **inc0401** is supplied in the SUF. Conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0420**, **inc0421**,  **inc0423** and  **inc0423**.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent. As a result, mean and median incomes are much lower than in previous data collections in these cohorts.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid3_v7-0-0","inc0411","inc0411","Besides the (manipulated) household income, we generate and provide the net equivalent household income using the modified OECD scale ([http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf](http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf)). For this generated variable, the household size and composition are taken into account. The concept is based on the assumption that people (e.g., two adults) save money and are fictitiously 'richer' by living together in one household and sharing a common budget and the fixed costs instead of living in separate households. For more information about the concept, see OECD (2011). For this purpose, the household composition recorded in the household questionnaire is used to calculate how many adult persons (aged 14 and older) and how many children (under 14) live in the household. In CATI 2 and 3, the household composition was not recorded systematically by the interviewer, but was surveyed in the household questionnaire. This self-report of the respondent was used as the basis for calculating the equivalence income. According to OECD (2011), the 'household head' gets a weight of 1, each further adult person gets a weight of 0.5, and each child a weight of 0.3. The household income is then divided by the sum of all weights in the household. The resulting variable **inc0411**, the net equivalent household income, is published in the SUF.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent.

The variable **liv0210** was generated by processing the available information into the twin perspective and on a personal level. Please note that from CATI 1 (**wid** == 2) onwards, the question 'Have you been living here since about a year ago?' (**liv0600**) was asked in advance. Only persons who answered 'No' to this question were asked about their living conditions in **liv0200** and **liv0310**. In the other cases, the previous year's information was inserted. The household type (**liv0400**: 'In what type of household do you live?') was also surveyed in a personal perspective (dependent on the person type that filled the household questionnaire). The question was asked regardless of whether or not a person had indicated that they had already lived in the apartment in the past year (**liv0600**). The information was processed into the generated variable **liv0410** that provides the information in a general and (between person types) comparable perspective.

In the first face-to-face data collection (F2F 1) the citizenship was surveyed in a multicoding format as a self-report and a proxy-report of parents about their children, offering the respondent to mention one or several citizenships and give open answers (**mig0500(t/u/s)** - **mig0519(t/u/s)**). In the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2), it was explicitly asked for the first citizenship as well as for the second citizenship, if applicable (including the offering of an open answer). The corresponding variables are **mig0550(t/u/s)** - **mig0553(t/u/s)**). The citizenship was surveyed of all respondents in both F2F 1 and F2F 2. It is stored, like the other migration variables, as constant variable in the master. In cases were the information given in F2F 2 differed from the one given in F2F 1, the latest information was used for the generation of **mig0520**.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid4_v7-0-0","eca0108","eca0108","The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is a classification of educational attainment and level of education. The ISCED classification takes into account the country-specific complexity of educational programs in terms of the type and duration of school or training. It ranges from 0 (pre-primary level of education) to 6 (second stage of tertiary education, leading to an advanced research qualification). The qualifications of the German education system can be assigned to the following ISCED-97 levels (cf. Schneider 2008):- Level 0: Pre-primary education, such as Kindergarten- Level 1: Primary school- Level 2B: Elementary and lower secondary school and apprenticeship training- Level 2A: Realschule, Mittlere Reife and Polytechnische Oberschule (GDR)- Level 3B: Vocational training in the dual system, intermediate administrative training, vocational/college school-leaving certificate and one-year schools of health services- Level 3A: Advanced technical college entrance qualification and Abitur (A-levels)- Level 4B: Combination of two vocational degrees in ISCED 3B- Level 4A: Qualification in both levels 3A and 3B- Level 5B: Master craftsman/technician, 2 to 3 year school of health services, technical/vocational academy, technical school diploma (GDR) and technical school of administration- Level 5A: Fachhochschule degree, university degree- Level 6: Doctorate, PhDThe variable **eca0108** is constructed from the two generated variables for the highest school leaving certificate (**eca0130**) and the highest vocational qualification (**eca0230**). The ISCED variable generated for TwinLife does not include level 2B, as information on pre-vocational programs is not available. In F2F2 (in contrast to F2F 1), additionally to the highest vocational qualification, information on a further professional qualification (**eca0221**) was collected. This also allows ISCED level 4B (combination of two vocational qualifications in level 3B) to be coded in F2F 2. However, a retroactive adjustment for F2F 1 could not be made, as the year of completion of the further education was not available. There is also no information on the length of training at health schools. In these cases, a minimum of two years was assumed when classifying according to ISCED levels.Please note that **eca0108** cannot be used as an ordinal scale because ISCED levels are divided into subcategories (e.g. levels 5A and 5B, where level 5A is a more advanced qualification than level 5B).For more information on the ISCED classification, see OECD (1999), and Schneider (2008).

Please note: For those participants who stated in the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2) that they had obtained a new school leaving certificate, the information on the highest school leaving certificate was collected again. For some respondents who were wrongly identified as first-surveyed respondents, there are also duplicate entries in F2F1 and F2F2. If a higher school leaving certificate was reported in F2F 2 and the certificate was obtained before the interview of the first data collection, the highest school qualification was corrected retroactively. Open statements were recoded into categories 1 to 5. Special school qualifications (Foerderschule) were equated with the 'Hauptschulabschluss'.

The second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2) again asked for the highest professional qualification as well as any further professional degree. If a higher professional certificate was reported in the second face-to-face data collection and the certificate was obtained before the interview of the first data collection, the highest professional qualification was corrected retroactively. The same applies to the family members who indicated in the first wave that they had obtained a degree from a 'Berufsakademie or Fachhochschule' (university of applied sciences, university of cooperative education). While these degrees were recorded jointly into one category in the first data collection (category 8), separate categories were introduced in the subsequent data collection (categories 6 and 7). A retroactive correction is thus made for those family members for whom both F2F1 and F2F2 contain information on the highest degree. The respondents' information on a second professional qualification (only available from F2F2) was also taken into account if this could be recognized as a higher qualification.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid4_v7-0-0","emp0503","emp0503","The International Standard Classification of Occupations from 2008 (ISCO-08) classifies occupations (internationally comparably) considering the required skill level (degree of complexity, based on the educational qualification) of an occupation as well as the skill specialization (the type of skills that are needed especially for this occupation). TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**). For more information about the ISCO classification visit the ILO website ([URL Link](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm)). The open-ended responses on occupation were coded into ISCO-08 by the survey institute (TNS Infratest/Kantar for F2F 1, infas for F2F 2), taking the following information into account, if available: occupational status (**emp0600**), public service yes/no (**emp0702**), supervisiory function (**emp0601**, **emp0603**, **emp0605**), type of managerial position (**emp0606**), educational degree (**eca0100**), and vocational training (**eca0200**). Infratest performs the coding on the basis of an electronically available directory developed by Statistik Austria (see TNS Infratest/Kantar ISCO-08 documentation ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/ISCO-08_coding_Infratest.pdf)) on the TwinLife documentation website ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads))). Infas bases the ISCO coding on specifications developed by GESIS. The exact procedure of occupation coding was described in detail by Geis and Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik (2000) using ISCO-88 as an example. In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

*Please note*: In the telephone surveys (CATI 1, CATI 2, etc.), questions about current occupation were only asked if the occupation had changed since the last survey (CATI 1: IF emp1400==1; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==2). For respondents who did not indicate a change in occupation (CATI 1: IF emp1400==2; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==1), we fill in **emp0503** on current occupation with information from the previous data collection. Note that some detailed employment information (such as detailed occupational status) was not asked in CATI to code occupation in ISCO-08 comparable to F2F 1 and F2F 2 when there was an occupational change. A direct comparison with the information in the face-to-face surveys may not be possible in some cases as a result.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid4_v7-0-0","inc0401","inc0401","Twin families are a special type of family that could be de-anonymized more easily than other families when combining several characteristics known from the data, especially when these characteristics exceedingly diverge from the average, such as a very high or very low income. In order to ensure the anonymity of the twin families, very high and very low values of the household income variable **inc0400** are manipulated in a way that the incomes cannot lead back to one household or individual, but the income distribution, as well as analyses, are not affected by the alterations. The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). In order to process a maximum of income information, the first step is to integrate the specification of income categories from **inc0403** into the variable **inc0400**. Here, the middle of the specified category is used. In F2F 2, CATI 2 and F2F 3, the yearly household income (**inc0404**) was also recorded as an alternative - this information is also converted first (divided by 12) and then integrated into **inc0400**. In CATI 1, household income was recorded at the personal level. Therefore, it may happen that within one household several different household incomes are specified. Here, the median of all information provided in the household was used. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable. As a result, 80% of the incomes are not affected by the manipulation. The resulting manipulated variable **inc0401** is supplied in the SUF. Conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0420**, **inc0421**,  **inc0423** and  **inc0423**.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent. As a result, mean and median incomes are much lower than in previous data collections in these cohorts.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid4_v7-0-0","inc0411","inc0411","Besides the (manipulated) household income, we generate and provide the net equivalent household income using the modified OECD scale ([http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf](http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf)). For this generated variable, the household size and composition are taken into account. The concept is based on the assumption that people (e.g., two adults) save money and are fictitiously 'richer' by living together in one household and sharing a common budget and the fixed costs instead of living in separate households. For more information about the concept, see OECD (2011). For this purpose, the household composition recorded in the household questionnaire is used to calculate how many adult persons (aged 14 and older) and how many children (under 14) live in the household. In CATI 2 and 3, the household composition was not recorded systematically by the interviewer, but was surveyed in the household questionnaire. This self-report of the respondent was used as the basis for calculating the equivalence income. According to OECD (2011), the 'household head' gets a weight of 1, each further adult person gets a weight of 0.5, and each child a weight of 0.3. The household income is then divided by the sum of all weights in the household. The resulting variable **inc0411**, the net equivalent household income, is published in the SUF.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid5_v7-0-0","brt0001","brt0001","The BART is a measuring instrument that can be used to record risk behavior scientifically and behaviorally. In the game, a balloon is inflated with individual pump blasts. In our experiment, 5 points were awarded for each of these pump blasts. Depending on the number of points achieved, participants could enter a lottery pot 1 time, 5 times (from about 2500 points), 7 times (from about 5000 points) or 10 times (from about 7500 points). A maximum of 128 pump blasts are possible, and the balloon can burst randomly at any time (i.e., even during the first pump blast). If the balloon bursts, the points of this balloon are lost. Therefore, it is always possible to save the points to a total account before the balloon bursts. In total there were 30 rounds with one balloon each. The variables in TwinLife contain the following information, for each round there is the same set of variables:
brt*00: Was the game stopped in this round? 
brt*01: Did the balloon burst in this round?
brt*02: How many pumps were made in this round?
There are also two total scores:
brt4000: number of total pumps
brt4001: number of rounds played
To calculate a measure of risk, the authors of the test (Lejuez et al., 2002) recommend forming a score based on the average number of pumps (brt*02) of trials in which the balloon did not burst (brt*01).

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid5_v7-0-0","eca0108","eca0108","The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is a classification of educational attainment and level of education. The ISCED classification takes into account the country-specific complexity of educational programs in terms of the type and duration of school or training. It ranges from 0 (pre-primary level of education) to 6 (second stage of tertiary education, leading to an advanced research qualification). The qualifications of the German education system can be assigned to the following ISCED-97 levels (cf. Schneider 2008):- Level 0: Pre-primary education, such as Kindergarten- Level 1: Primary school- Level 2B: Elementary and lower secondary school and apprenticeship training- Level 2A: Realschule, Mittlere Reife and Polytechnische Oberschule (GDR)- Level 3B: Vocational training in the dual system, intermediate administrative training, vocational/college school-leaving certificate and one-year schools of health services- Level 3A: Advanced technical college entrance qualification and Abitur (A-levels)- Level 4B: Combination of two vocational degrees in ISCED 3B- Level 4A: Qualification in both levels 3A and 3B- Level 5B: Master craftsman/technician, 2 to 3 year school of health services, technical/vocational academy, technical school diploma (GDR) and technical school of administration- Level 5A: Fachhochschule degree, university degree- Level 6: Doctorate, PhDThe variable **eca0108** is constructed from the two generated variables for the highest school leaving certificate (**eca0130**) and the highest vocational qualification (**eca0230**). The ISCED variable generated for TwinLife does not include level 2B, as information on pre-vocational programs is not available. In F2F2 (in contrast to F2F 1), additionally to the highest vocational qualification, information on a further professional qualification (**eca0221**) was collected. This also allows ISCED level 4B (combination of two vocational qualifications in level 3B) to be coded in F2F 2. However, a retroactive adjustment for F2F 1 could not be made, as the year of completion of the further education was not available. There is also no information on the length of training at health schools. In these cases, a minimum of two years was assumed when classifying according to ISCED levels.Please note that **eca0108** cannot be used as an ordinal scale because ISCED levels are divided into subcategories (e.g. levels 5A and 5B, where level 5A is a more advanced qualification than level 5B).For more information on the ISCED classification, see OECD (1999), and Schneider (2008).

Please note: For those participants who stated in the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2) that they had obtained a new school leaving certificate, the information on the highest school leaving certificate was collected again. For some respondents who were wrongly identified as first-surveyed respondents, there are also duplicate entries in F2F1 and F2F2. If a higher school leaving certificate was reported in F2F 2 and the certificate was obtained before the interview of the first data collection, the highest school qualification was corrected retroactively. Open statements were recoded into categories 1 to 5. Special school qualifications (Foerderschule) were equated with the 'Hauptschulabschluss'.

While these degrees were recorded jointly into one category in the first data collection (category 8), separate categories were introduced in the subsequent data collection (categories 6 and 7). A retroactive correction is thus made for those family members for whom both F2F1 and F2F2 contain information on the highest degree.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid5_v7-0-0","emp0503","emp0503","The International Standard Classification of Occupations from 2008 (ISCO-08) classifies occupations (internationally comparably) considering the required skill level (degree of complexity, based on the educational qualification) of an occupation as well as the skill specialization (the type of skills that are needed especially for this occupation). TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**). For more information about the ISCO classification visit the ILO website ([URL Link](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm)). The open-ended responses on occupation were coded into ISCO-08 by the survey institute (TNS Infratest/Kantar for F2F 1, infas for F2F 2), taking the following information into account, if available: occupational status (**emp0600**), public service yes/no (**emp0702**), supervisiory function (**emp0601**, **emp0603**, **emp0605**), type of managerial position (**emp0606**), educational degree (**eca0100**), and vocational training (**eca0200**). Infratest performs the coding on the basis of an electronically available directory developed by Statistik Austria (see TNS Infratest/Kantar ISCO-08 documentation ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/ISCO-08_coding_Infratest.pdf)) on the TwinLife documentation website ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads))). Infas bases the ISCO coding on specifications developed by GESIS. The exact procedure of occupation coding was described in detail by Geis and Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik (2000) using ISCO-88 as an example. In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

*Please note*: In the telephone surveys (CATI 1, CATI 2, etc.), questions about current occupation were only asked if the occupation had changed since the last survey (CATI 1: IF emp1400==1; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==2). For respondents who did not indicate a change in occupation (CATI 1: IF emp1400==2; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==1), we fill in **emp0503** on current occupation with information from the previous data collection. Note that some detailed employment information (such as detailed occupational status) was not asked in CATI to code occupation in ISCO-08 comparable to F2F 1 and F2F 2 when there was an occupational change.

For the generation of the EGP of the occupational activity (**emp0508**) the ISCO-08 variable **emp0503_iuf** (4 digits (unit group level), not part of the Scientific Use File) needed to be translated in the ISCO-88 classification first, using the Stata ado *iscogen.ado* that bases on a conversion tool by Harry Ganzeboom ([URL Link](http://www.harryganzeboom.nl/isco08/index.htm)). 

```

The necessary information about the number of employees (**supviss**) only differentiates between whether the person supervises more than one and less than ten persons (**supviss** == 2), or more than ten persons (**supviss** == 11). It is based on information about the occupational status (from **emp0601** and **emp0605**) and the actual number of employees when being self-employed (**emp0603**):

```
gen supviss = .
replace supviss = 2 if emp0603 == 2     // self-employed with 1-9 employees
replace supviss = 11 if emp0603 == 3     // self-employed w. 10+ employees
replace supviss = 2 if emp0601 >= 4     // assumption: 1-9 subordinates
replace supviss = 2 if emp0605 == 6     // assumption: 1-9 subordinates

It was developed from the EGP (Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero) scheme. The categories of the ESeC summarize occupations according to their position in the labor market and the type of labor regulation. The information required to create ESeC is: occupation coded to the minor groups (i.e. 3-digit groups) of the EU variant of the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO88 (COM)); details of employment status, i.e. whether an employer, self-employed or employee; number of employees at the workplace; whether a worker is a supervisor.

Therefore, an east-west indicator (**ewi**) was generated by dividing the German states (Bundeslaender) into two groups depending on their former affiliation to Western Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) or Eastern Germany (German Democratic Republic). Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein belong to former Western Germany; Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia belong to former Eastern Germany. According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Berlin as a whole is count as part of former Eastern Germany. **ewi** is available on the household level. 
Please note that regional variables are generated from contextual information based on a household's contact address. In case of inconsistencies within a household ID, the regional information of the twins was prioritized over the information of the other household members. However, these inconsistencies occurred only in very rare cases.",""

In order to ensure the anonymity of the twin families, very high and very low values of the personal income variable **inc0100** is manipulated in a way that the incomes cannot lead back to one individual, but the income distribution, as well as analyses, are not affected by the alterations. The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). Personal income was collected in variable **inc0100** in all data collections except CATI 2 and 3. First, only for CATI 1 a categorical variable (corresponding to **inc0103**) is generated from the variables **inc0102**, **inc0105**, **inc0106**. In the next step, for the cases in which no monthly personal income was reported, the annual income from **inc0101** (if available) is divided by 12 and integrated into **inc0100**. A single case correction was made in F2F 1, where monthly and annual income were obviously confused (**pid_suf** == 124589400). Other conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0120** and **inc0121**. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable. As a result, 80% of the incomes are not affected by the manipulation. The resulting manipulated variable **inc0110** is supplied in the SUF.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid5_v7-0-0","inc0401","inc0401","Twin families are a special type of family that could be de-anonymized more easily than other families when combining several characteristics known from the data, especially when these characteristics exceedingly diverge from the average, such as a very high or very low income. In order to ensure the anonymity of the twin families, very high and very low values of the household income variable **inc0400** are manipulated in a way that the incomes cannot lead back to one household or individual, but the income distribution, as well as analyses, are not affected by the alterations. The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). In order to process a maximum of income information, the first step is to integrate the specification of income categories from **inc0403** into the variable **inc0400**. Here, the middle of the specified category is used. In F2F 2, CATI 2 and F2F 3, the yearly household income (**inc0404**) was also recorded as an alternative - this information is also converted first (divided by 12) and then integrated into **inc0400**. In CATI 1, household income was recorded at the personal level. Therefore, it may happen that within one household several different household incomes are specified. Here, the median of all information provided in the household was used. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable. As a result, 80% of the incomes are not affected by the manipulation. The resulting manipulated variable **inc0401** is supplied in the SUF. Conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0420**, **inc0421**,  **inc0423** and  **inc0423**.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent. As a result, mean and median incomes are much lower than in previous data collections in these cohorts.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid5_v7-0-0","inc0411","inc0411","Besides the (manipulated) household income, we generate and provide the net equivalent household income using the modified OECD scale ([http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf](http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf)). For this generated variable, the household size and composition are taken into account. The concept is based on the assumption that people (e.g., two adults) save money and are fictitiously 'richer' by living together in one household and sharing a common budget and the fixed costs instead of living in separate households. For more information about the concept, see OECD (2011). For this purpose, the household composition recorded in the household questionnaire is used to calculate how many adult persons (aged 14 and older) and how many children (under 14) live in the household. In CATI 2 and 3, the household composition was not recorded systematically by the interviewer, but was surveyed in the household questionnaire. This self-report of the respondent was used as the basis for calculating the equivalence income. According to OECD (2011), the 'household head' gets a weight of 1, each further adult person gets a weight of 0.5, and each child a weight of 0.3. The household income is then divided by the sum of all weights in the household. The resulting variable **inc0411**, the net equivalent household income, is published in the SUF.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent.

In the first face-to-face data collection (F2F 1) the citizenship was surveyed in a multicoding format as a self-report and a proxy-report of parents about their children, offering the respondent to mention one or several citizenships and give open answers (**mig0500(t/u/s)** - **mig0519(t/u/s)**). In the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2), it was explicitly asked for the first citizenship as well as for the second citizenship, if applicable (including the offering of an open answer). The corresponding variables are **mig0550(t/u/s)** - **mig0553(t/u/s)**). The citizenship was surveyed of all respondents in both F2F 1 and F2F 2. It is stored, like the other migration variables, as constant variable in the master. In cases were the information given in F2F 2 differed from the one given in F2F 1, the latest information was used for the generation of **mig0520**.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid6_v7-0-0","eca0108","eca0108","The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) is a classification of educational attainment and level of education. The ISCED classification takes into account the country-specific complexity of educational programs in terms of the type and duration of school or training. It ranges from 0 (pre-primary level of education) to 6 (second stage of tertiary education, leading to an advanced research qualification). The qualifications of the German education system can be assigned to the following ISCED-97 levels (cf. Schneider 2008):- Level 0: Pre-primary education, such as Kindergarten- Level 1: Primary school- Level 2B: Elementary and lower secondary school and apprenticeship training- Level 2A: Realschule, Mittlere Reife and Polytechnische Oberschule (GDR)- Level 3B: Vocational training in the dual system, intermediate administrative training, vocational/college school-leaving certificate and one-year schools of health services- Level 3A: Advanced technical college entrance qualification and Abitur (A-levels)- Level 4B: Combination of two vocational degrees in ISCED 3B- Level 4A: Qualification in both levels 3A and 3B- Level 5B: Master craftsman/technician, 2 to 3 year school of health services, technical/vocational academy, technical school diploma (GDR) and technical school of administration- Level 5A: Fachhochschule degree, university degree- Level 6: Doctorate, PhDThe variable **eca0108** is constructed from the two generated variables for the highest school leaving certificate (**eca0130**) and the highest vocational qualification (**eca0230**). The ISCED variable generated for TwinLife does not include level 2B, as information on pre-vocational programs is not available. In F2F2 (in contrast to F2F 1), additionally to the highest vocational qualification, information on a further professional qualification (**eca0221**) was collected. This also allows ISCED level 4B (combination of two vocational qualifications in level 3B) to be coded in F2F 2. However, a retroactive adjustment for F2F 1 could not be made, as the year of completion of the further education was not available. There is also no information on the length of training at health schools. In these cases, a minimum of two years was assumed when classifying according to ISCED levels.Please note that **eca0108** cannot be used as an ordinal scale because ISCED levels are divided into subcategories (e.g. levels 5A and 5B, where level 5A is a more advanced qualification than level 5B).For more information on the ISCED classification, see OECD (1999), and Schneider (2008).

Please note: For those participants who stated in the second face-to-face data collection (F2F 2) that they had obtained a new school leaving certificate, the information on the highest school leaving certificate was collected again. For some respondents who were wrongly identified as first-surveyed respondents, there are also duplicate entries in F2F1 and F2F2. If a higher school leaving certificate was reported in F2F 2 and the certificate was obtained before the interview of the first data collection, the highest school qualification was corrected retroactively. Open statements were recoded into categories 1 to 5. Special school qualifications (Foerderschule) were equated with the 'Hauptschulabschluss'.

While these degrees were recorded jointly into one category in the first data collection (category 8), separate categories were introduced in the subsequent data collection (categories 6 and 7). A retroactive correction is thus made for those family members for whom both F2F1 and F2F2 contain information on the highest degree. The respondents' information on a second professional qualification (only available from F2F2) was also taken into account if this could be recognized as a higher qualification. Open statements were recoded into categories 1 to 10. Open entries that could not be assigned to these categories were recoded into -89 (not codable).",""

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid6_v7-0-0","emp0503","emp0503","The International Standard Classification of Occupations from 2008 (ISCO-08) classifies occupations (internationally comparably) considering the required skill level (degree of complexity, based on the educational qualification) of an occupation as well as the skill specialization (the type of skills that are needed especially for this occupation). TwinLife delivers the ISCO classification on the sub-major group level (two digits) for the occupational activity (**emp0503** and **emp0513**), the field of study of the highest vocational qualification (**eca0205**) and as well as the occupational activities of the twins' grandparents (**bpa0208**, **bpa0308**, **bpa0508**, **bpa0608**). For more information about the ISCO classification visit the ILO website ([URL Link](http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm)). The open-ended responses on occupation were coded into ISCO-08 by the survey institute (TNS Infratest/Kantar for F2F 1, infas for F2F 2), taking the following information into account, if available: occupational status (**emp0600**), public service yes/no (**emp0702**), supervisiory function (**emp0601**, **emp0603**, **emp0605**), type of managerial position (**emp0606**), educational degree (**eca0100**), and vocational training (**eca0200**). Infratest performs the coding on the basis of an electronically available directory developed by Statistik Austria (see TNS Infratest/Kantar ISCO-08 documentation ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/images/TwinLife/Downloads/ISCO-08_coding_Infratest.pdf)) on the TwinLife documentation website ([URL Link](https://www.twin-life.de/documentation/downloads))). Infas bases the ISCO coding on specifications developed by GESIS. The exact procedure of occupation coding was described in detail by Geis and Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik (2000) using ISCO-88 as an example. In addition, extensive guidance on the practical implementation of occupational coding can be found in Geis (2011). Building on this knowledge of ISCO-88, there is the ISCO-08 code scheme, explanations and notes on the differences between ISCO-08 and ISCO-88. These have been coordinated by infas with GESIS. Specifications that could not translated into the schemes (such as 'team leader', 'specialist', or 'intern') were coded into -81 (no occupation or occupational activity mentioned) or -89 (not codable).

*Please note*: In the telephone surveys (CATI 1, CATI 2, etc.), questions about current occupation were only asked if the occupation had changed since the last survey (CATI 1: IF emp1400==1; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==2). For respondents who did not indicate a change in occupation (CATI 1: IF emp1400==2; CATI 2 ff.: IF emp0520==1), we fill in **emp0503** on current occupation with information from the previous data collection. Note that some detailed employment information (such as detailed occupational status) was not asked in CATI to code occupation in ISCO-08 comparable to F2F 1 and F2F 2 when there was an occupational change. A direct comparison with the information in the face-to-face surveys may not be possible in some cases as a result.

The information required to create ESeC is: occupation coded to the minor groups (i.e. 3-digit groups) of the EU variant of the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO88 (COM)); details of employment status, i.e. whether an employer, self-employed or employee; number of employees at the workplace; whether a worker is a supervisor.

Therefore, an east-west indicator (**ewi**) was generated by dividing the German states (Bundeslaender) into two groups depending on their former affiliation to Western Germany (Federal Republic of Germany) or Eastern Germany (German Democratic Republic). Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Bremen, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Saarland and Schleswig-Holstein belong to former Western Germany; Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia belong to former Eastern Germany. According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Berlin as a whole is count as part of former Eastern Germany. **ewi** is available on the household level. 
Please note that regional variables are generated from contextual information based on a household's contact address. In case of inconsistencies within a household ID, the regional information of the twins was prioritized over the information of the other household members.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid6_v7-0-0","inc0401","inc0401","Twin families are a special type of family that could be de-anonymized more easily than other families when combining several characteristics known from the data, especially when these characteristics exceedingly diverge from the average, such as a very high or very low income. In order to ensure the anonymity of the twin families, very high and very low values of the household income variable **inc0400** are manipulated in a way that the incomes cannot lead back to one household or individual, but the income distribution, as well as analyses, are not affected by the alterations. The manipulation follows the recommendations of Wirth (1992). In order to process a maximum of income information, the first step is to integrate the specification of income categories from **inc0403** into the variable **inc0400**. Here, the middle of the specified category is used. In F2F 2, CATI 2 and F2F 3, the yearly household income (**inc0404**) was also recorded as an alternative - this information is also converted first (divided by 12) and then integrated into **inc0400**. In CATI 1, household income was recorded at the personal level. Therefore, it may happen that within one household several different household incomes are specified. Here, the median of all information provided in the household was used. Finally, following Wirth (1992), the five highest and lowest income specifications are replaced by their average (manipulation of the strongest outliers) and the 10% highest and lowest income statements are assigned a random error of +/- 1% of the initial value using a random variable. As a result, 80% of the incomes are not affected by the manipulation. The resulting manipulated variable **inc0401** is supplied in the SUF. Conspicuities are recorded and flagged in the variables **inc0420**, **inc0421**,  **inc0423** and  **inc0423**.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent. As a result, mean and median incomes are much lower than in previous data collections in these cohorts.

"twinlife","ZA6701_person_wid6_v7-0-0","inc0411","inc0411","Besides the (manipulated) household income, we generate and provide the net equivalent household income using the modified OECD scale ([http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf](http://www.oecd.org/els/soc/OECD-Note-EquivalenceScales.pdf)). For this generated variable, the household size and composition are taken into account. The concept is based on the assumption that people (e.g., two adults) save money and are fictitiously 'richer' by living together in one household and sharing a common budget and the fixed costs instead of living in separate households. For more information about the concept, see OECD (2011). For this purpose, the household composition recorded in the household questionnaire is used to calculate how many adult persons (aged 14 and older) and how many children (under 14) live in the household. In CATI 2 and 3, the household composition was not recorded systematically by the interviewer, but was surveyed in the household questionnaire. This self-report of the respondent was used as the basis for calculating the equivalence income. According to OECD (2011), the 'household head' gets a weight of 1, each further adult person gets a weight of 0.5, and each child a weight of 0.3. The household income is then divided by the sum of all weights in the household. The resulting variable **inc0411**, the net equivalent household income, is published in the SUF.

*Please note*: Due to the reduced questionnaire in CATI 2 (wid=4), twins in cohorts 3 and 4 were not asked about their household income if they were still living with at least one parent.
